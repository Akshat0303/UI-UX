This repository contains UI wireframes and designs for a college Parking Helper Android app.

Login: The student/faculty logs into the app via a user ID and a password, provided by the college administration. 

Dashboard: This screen shows the status of the parking lot, ie, number of open and reserved spots. There is a logout button at the bottom of the screen.

Parking Lot map: This screen allows the user to browse through the physical scene of the parking lot. This shows all the available spots.  On selecting an available spot, the user is asked to confirm their reservation and the spot is hence, reserved. 

If there is any spot already reserved by the user, it will also be displayed on the Dashboard, from where they can either release the spot or open the map of the parking lot to find the spot, in case they could not locate the spot.
